# Motivation
I have seen a lot of analysis about technicals of  the stack overflow surveys.

However, As one of minority in my society, I wondered about inequalities in the IT industry.

I set 3 main issues which are 1. gender wage gap, 2. sexual minorities' job satisfaction and 3. coloured people's wage gap and work hours.
